# Purpose

This is a quick assessment of the Laravel Framework, just to experiment and learn a little about the framework.

## Code

In the `routes/api.php` file I have added some simple Get endpoints designed to return sample records from an SQLite file stored at, ` app/database/database.sqlite`.

There is one seeder `app/database/seeders/UsersTableSeeder.php` using Faker to generate several sample user accounts.
